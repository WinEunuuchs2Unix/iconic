## Place desktop icons evenly to any monitor

**iconic** solves problems for your Desktop and adds extra functionality:

-   Move all icons to any one of three monitors
-   Define a grid size to spread icons evenly across desktop as close or far apart as you prefer
-   Do not suffer the "lost icon syndrome" that occurs when monitors of multiple resolutions are used
-   Sort icons alphabetically, alphabetically with "Link to" prefix ignored, sort by modified date ascending or date descending
-   Allow different grid size (columns x rows) depending on monitor, EG more on 4K monitor than 2K monitor
-   Instant Test button for quick experimentation on column x row changes or reserved space changes for monitor left, top, right or bottom areas
-   Test button will last for x seconds defined by you, clear all windows before test and restore them after test
-   Save icon configuration and load saved configuration - handy for different monitors at home and work
-   Bash script for easy modifications

## iconic Monitors Notebook

The notebook provides multiple tabs for accessing Monitors General settings and a tab for each individual monitor.

The General settings tab allows you to set the monitor where desktop icons are placed. Additionally global definition of reserved space on left, top, right and bottom of monitors where icons should not go. Do this to allow space for window manager launchers and application indicator bars.
